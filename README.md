# idea
calculate your playtime in minecraft with the files you own
this means:
- your singleplayer worlds
- offline or online server files
specify the filepaths and a username.

GUI! with egui
graph?
table on both
export in text, or json
{
    hours, type (singleplayer|mp|mp(offlinemode)), world name, folder name, anything else?
}
